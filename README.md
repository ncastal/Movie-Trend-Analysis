To draw a general conclusion, the movie industry peaked in 2014 however has been
declining since. Though no concrete conclusion was established there are some hypothesis
stating this decline could be due to online streaming services such as Netflix. Looking at Netflix
current events in 2014 Netflix had invested over $3 Billion into their infrastructure to push out
their name and get people to use them the most. Going into 2015 Netflix doubled their
investment to $6 billion. We conclude that because of the ease of Netflix and cost efficacy
people are choosing to watch movies from their own sofa rather than going into a theater.
To add on, movies with a higher budget tend to have higher grossing revenue. This was
found by aggregating data comparing the top producers and analyzing their budget cost vs
gross revenue.
Movies that tend to do the best were of the genre Action and Comedy. On the flip side
movie genres that did the worst included drama and horror.
Taking a deeper dive into the genre and subgenre and how the data was retrieved
shows movie goers watching a movie with the genre of drama tend to leave ratings the most.
Our conclusion would say drama movies can tend to lean different ways with different viewers
which is why people are more inclined to leave a rating.
The final conclusion we had was that male moviegoers between 30-44 showed the most
interest in movies. Now this data set could possibly have a lot of misleading data into it mostly
it is the person buying the tickets that typically leaves to review. For example, if a dad goes to
the movies with his family, he will tend to end up leaving the 4 reviews which would be biased.
